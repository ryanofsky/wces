      <P align=justify>Welcome to the SEAS Oracle! Why is it the SEAS Oracle? 
      Here you will find a vast amount of information about academics here at 
      FUSEAS. You'll learn facts about your professors and courses that you 
      never knew before. This site contains the largest compilation of Columbia 
      Course/Professor information. You'll find out interesting facts about your 
      professors, like their research, education, etc. You'll also find the 
      results of those course evaluations you fill out every semester. You 
      deserve access to this information and here you will find it. This site 
      won't tell you your future, but it'll help you decide it! </P>
      <P align=justify>Course Evaluations are used to improve the quality of 
      education at universities across the nation and worldwide. Although the 
      evaluations do not always reflect on courses and their professors 
      accurately, they are still a necessary measure of quality and needed 
      improvement. Many leading institutions, such as Yale, Duke, and since last 
      year, Columbia, publish the results in order to assist students in their 
      selection of classes. Last year's publications of Course Evaluation 
      results was met with great success and impressive, positive student 
      feedback. There were approximately 500 hits per day to our server during 
      registration for the Fall 99 Semester. This constistutes to about 50% of 
      the SEAS student body looking at the content of the Oracle everyday for 
      one week. </P>
      <P align=justify>This year we took last year's constructive feedback to 
      heart and have worked to further improve this service to students. We have 
      designed, constructed and implemented a database backend that will store 
      information for each year by semester from now on. Therefore, students 
      will be able to view evaluation data not only for one semester, but for a 
      history of semesters. This gives a much better picture of the class and 
      the abilities of the professors. Moreover, we've changed the layout of the 
      Oracle from a slow loading applet to a quick webpage powered by 
      javascript, MySQL, and PHP. In addition, with the launch of the WCES, 
      students will now be able to see the results of their evaluations in real 
      time, immediately after completing their class evaluations! 
      <P align=justify>Last year's success allowed us to make these great 
      improvements. The best has yet to come! </P></FONT><!-- End of main info ---><BR>
