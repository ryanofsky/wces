<p align="justify">Welcome to the SEAS Oracle!</p>

<p align="justify">The SEAS Oracle has a vast amount of information
about academics here at the Fu Foundation School of engineering and
Applied Science. This site contains the largest compilation of
Columbia Course/ Professor information. You&rsquo;ll learn useful
and interesting facts about professors and courses, including
background, research, education and more. You&rsquo;ll also see the
results of those course evaluations you fill out every
semester.</p>

<p align="justify">Course Evaluations are used to improve the
quality of education at universities across the nation and
worldwide. Although the evaluations do not always reflect on
courses and their professors accurately, they are still a necessary
measure of quality and needed improvement. The Oracle can assist
students in their selection of classes.</p>

<p align="justify">This year we took last year's constructive
feedback to heart and have worked to further improve this service
to students and faculty. We have designed, constructed and
implemented a database that will store information for each year by
semester. Therefore, students and faculty will be able to view
evaluation data semester to semester. This gives faculty and
students a better picture of the class and the abilities of the
professors. </p>
