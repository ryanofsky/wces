  <h3>System Overview</h3>

  <p>The <b>Web-Based Course Evaluation System</b> (WCES) seeks to give
  students greater ease and peace of mind in evaluating their classes while
  allowing for greater flexibility and data integrity from the perspective of
  the evaluations' administrators. The course feedback gathered through this
  mechanism should be useful for professors and students alike.</p>

  <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
     
  <p>WCES securely stores student class evaluations. Student user names are not
  associated with individual class evaluations. The system is set up so that 
  <i>it is not possible for an administrator or professor to find out what
  responses were entered by a particular student.</i> Responses are completely
  anonymous because student responses are kept separately from student user
  names.</p>
  
  <p>Student user names are, however, used to make sure that every student
  evaluates his or her own classes, and does it only once per class. Also, if a
  student enters something other than his or her user name, the
  administrator of the system may be notified. This is the only occasion where
  student input is checked, and the student will be identified to the system
  administrator in the case of incorrect input. All other data entered by
  student is completely anonymous and impossible to track by the system
  administrator. Therefore feel free to evaluate your classes honestly and
  candidly!</p>
