      <p>
      WCES securely stores student class evaluations. Student user names are not associated with individual
      class evaluations. The system is set up so that <i> it is not possible for an administrator or professor
      to find out what responses were entered by a particular student.</i> Responses are completely anonymous
      because student responses are kept separately from student user names.</p>
      <p>
      Student user names are, however, used to make sure that every student evaluates his or her own classes,
      and does it only once per class. Also, if a student enters something other than his or her CUNIX user name,
      the administrator of the system may be notified. This is the only occasion where student input is checked,
      and the student will be identified to the system administrator in the case of incorrect input. All other
      data entered by student is completely anonymous and impossible to track by the system administrator.
      Therefore feel free to evaluate your classes honestly and candidly!
