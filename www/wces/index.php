      <h3>System Overview</h3>
      <p><img src="media/pencil.gif" width="74" height="42" align="left" valign="top">
      The <b>Web-Based Course Evaluation System</b> (WCES) is the first step toward automating
      and eventually replacing the current offline method of distributing and administering
      course evaluations for classes within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and
      Applied Sciences in Columbia University. WCES seeks to give students 
	  greater ease and peace of mind in evaluating
      their classes while allowing for greater flexibility and data integrity from the
      perspective of the evaluations' administrators. The course feedback gathered through
      this mechanism should be useful for professors and students alike.
	
	  <p>The WCES is <b>COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS!!</b> It was created by students, for students.
	  We know exactly how important your privacy is.  If you are skeptical, please email
	  James Zheng at <a href=mailto:wces@columbia.edu>wces@columbia.edu</a> and he will
	  explain everything to you!</p>

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p><b>Students. </b>Choose "Complete a survey" under the students section at the left
      to evaluate your classes for this semester. Choose "View Survey Results" to see the results
      of past surveys and to learn more about Columbia's classes and professors.</p>
      <p><b>Professors. </b>Choose "Home" under the professors section at the left to log in
