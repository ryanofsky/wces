      System (WCES) is the first step toward automating and eventually replacing 
      the current offline method of distributing and administering course evaluations 
      for classes within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences 
      in Columbia University. WCES has been developed by a team of five students 
      from the Fall 1999 offering of Introduction to Software Engineering (CS3156). 
      WCES seeks to give students greater ease and peace of mind in evaluating 
      their classes while allowing for greater flexibility and data integrity 
      from the perspective of the evaluations' administrators. The course feedback 
      gathered through this mechanism should be useful for professors and students 
      alike.<br><br><br><b>FACULTY AND STUDENTS NOTE</b>: You must have a valid cunix id i.e. al412@columbia.edu to use WCES.  If you have any questions, please contact <a href=mailto:wces@columbia.edu>wces@columbia.edu</a>.  Thank you.</font></td>
