      about academics here at Columbia FUSEAS. You'll learn facts about your professors 
      and courses that you never knew before. This site contains the largest compilation 
      of Columbia Course/Professor information. You'll find out interesting facts 
      about your professors, like their research, education, etc. You'll also 
      find the results of those course evaluations you fill out every semester. 
      You deserve access to this information and here you will find it. This site 
      won't tell you your future, but it'll help you decide it!</p>    </td>

    <td valign=top><p>The Web-Based Course Evaluation 
      System (WCES) is the first step toward automating and eventually replacing 
      the current offline method of distributing and administering course evaluations 
      for classes within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences 
      in Columbia University. WCES has been developed by a team of five students 
      from the Fall 1999 offering of Introduction to Software Engineering (CS3156). 
      WCES seeks to give students greater ease and peace of mind in evaluating 
      their classes while allowing for greater flexibility and data integrity 
      from the perspective of the evaluations' administrators. The course feedback 
      gathered through this mechanism should be useful for professors and students 
      alike.</p>
      <p><b>FACULTY AND STUDENTS NOTE</b>: You must have a valid cunix id i.e. al412@columbia.edu to log into WCES.</p>    </td>
