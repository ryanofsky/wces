  - there are many duplicate professor listings. it is easy to find 
    them by just printing a list of duplicate lastnames for professors
    who teach classes which are in the wces_topics table. this hasn't
    been done in a long time, and the problem is worse now because
    of jackie's professor list which had bad data.
