Dear Dean McGourty,

	1. first contact Robert Bloomfield, and ask him for a file containing
information for all the courses being offered this semester is SEAS...he
will normally send back an Excel file..

	2.  james/whoever will then have to open the file up in Excel and create
another file that is separated by tabs...

	3.  using wces, create a new semester using the file created by Excel
above..

	that's it...

	i hope this helps...i'll be willing to help however i can...

Sincerely,

Boyle M Lee

Boyle:

Can you refresh my memory as to how we worked witht he registrar to get
what was needed to open WCES for midterm evaluations? Just describe the
process to me and who you worked with.

I want to set up a meeting with James and Corey and the registrar next
week.

Thanks Jack
